ISU <em>FLU</em>ture is an interactive web-based tool developed to provide  diagnostic information from an Influenza A Virus database of test results, metadata, and sequences collected at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. The goal of ISU <em>FLU</em>ture is to allow veterinarians, swine producers, and researchers to seek out and find trends in the data that will allow them to make informed decisions regarding influenza and swine health. ISU <em>FLU</em>ture data is derived from diagnostic samples submitted from a diverse array of swine farms and production systems around the United States and North America. The metadata used at ISU <em>FLU</em>ture is dependent on submitters supplying accurate and thorough information provided on submission forms with diagnostic samples to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

<h2>Suite of Tools</h2>
<p>
<strong>Correlations</strong><br>
Over 100 unique correlation graphs can be generated to search for trends from variables stored in the database.<br>
<strong>Time Series</strong><br>
The incidence of the variables in the database can be viewed over a period of time<br>
<strong>Regional</strong><br>
The incidence of flu positive cases that have been processed by the USDA/ISU-VDL can be viewed by geographic location, over a specified period of time.<br>
<strong>Heat Map</strong><br>
Demonstrates the distribution of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtype combinations over a period of time.<br>

<a name="variables"><h2>Variables</h2></a>
<p>
The ISU <em>FLU</em>ture database curates information related to the individual swine cases. An explanation of each of the variables that ISU <em>FLU</em>ture allows searching for can be found below.<br/><br/>

<strong>Age</strong><br/>
The age of the pig at the time the flu positive sample was taken.<br/>

<strong>Data Source</strong><br/>
The stream that handeled the sequencing of the sample. Samples with cycle threshold (CT) values less then or equal to 25 are handled by the USDA stream, while samples with CT values less then or equal to 38 are processed by the ISU VDL stream. Samples with CT values above 38 are not sequenced.<br/>

<strong>Day</strong><br/>
The day of the year that the flu positive sample was taken.<br/>

<strong>HA Clade</strong><br/>
The phylogenetic clade that a flu positive sample is part of, based on the hemagglutinin sequence. Currently the ISU <em>FLU</em>ture database tracks only H1 and H3 subtype hemagglutinin, thus clades will be derived from one of these subtypes.<br/>

<strong>HA Sequence</strong><br/>
The genetic sequence of the hemagglutinin of a specific influenza virus case. Sequencing is only attempted for sample with cycle threshold (CT) values less then or equal to 38.<br/>

<strong>Month</strong><br/>
The month of the year that the flu positive sample was taken.<br/>

<strong>NA Clade</strong><br/>
The phylogenetic clade that a flu positive sample is part of, based on neuraminidase. Currently the ISU <em>FLU</em>ture database tracks only N1 and N2 subtype neuraminidase, thus clades will be derived from one of these subtypes. Only samples with cycle threshold (CT) values less then or equal to 25 are sequenced, and are applicable for this type of data.<br/>

<strong>PCR Specimen</strong><br/>
The specimen from which the subtyping RT-PCR was derived from.<br/>

<strong>Sequence Specimen</strong><br/>
The specimen that was used for attempting sequencing.<br/>

<strong>Site State</strong><br/>
The state that the pig was located in when the sample was taken for submission to the veterinary diagnostic laboratory.<br/>

<strong>Subtype</strong><br/>
The subtype of the influenza virus, based on PCR identificatin of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins.<br/>

<strong>Week</strong><br/>
The week of the year that the flu positive sample was taken.<br/>

<strong>Year</strong><br/>
The year that the flu positive sample was taken.<br/>
